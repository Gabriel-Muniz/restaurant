            Created by me (Gabriel), that’s the website for my restaurant,
            Gabriel’s (that’s me) Restaurant. In this website you’ll find pages
            for my dishes(Not real by the way), and more things about me
            (Gabriel (That’s me)).

            That’s me (Gabriel), actually it’s not. No way i would put a picture
            of me in this website. But i need to put things on this page so
            you(Not me) can have something to see. It’s actually really hard to
            write things about things like this site, because this Gabriel’s(me)
            Restaurant doesn’t really exists...
